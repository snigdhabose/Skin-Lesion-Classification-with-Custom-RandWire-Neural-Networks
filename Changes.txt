randwirenn.py:

Added batch normalization layers
Implemented dropout for regularization
Kept the random wiring concept


train.py:

Implemented data augmentation for training set
Added validation set and loop
Implemented learning rate scheduler
Increased model complexity (larger hidden layers)
Increased number of epochs
Implemented early stopping (save best model)


test.py:

Added device (CPU/GPU) support
Implemented more comprehensive evaluation metrics (classification report, confusion matrix)
Updated model architecture to match the improved train.py
Added visualization of the confusion matrix


main.py:

Added learning rate scheduler
Implemented validation during training
Added early stopping (save best model)
Increased number of epochs
Added device (CPU/GPU) support
Adjusted hyperparameters for better performance
